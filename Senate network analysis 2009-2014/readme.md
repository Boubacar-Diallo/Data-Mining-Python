The U.S. Senate is the upper legislative chamber of Congress consisting of 100 members, with 2 senators representing each of the 50 states on a 6-year term. For every 2 years, a third of the senate seats are eligible for re-election during the midterm elections. Senators are also often prime candidates for U.S. presidencies and cabinet positions such as the Secretary of State.
The 112th-113th U.S. Congress (2011-2014) is often described as partisan, polarised and divided. This is in part driven by Democratic control of the Senate and Republican control of the House of Representatives that have fundamentally opposite legislative priorities and ideologies after the 2010 mid-term election. **senate2014.ipynb** examines the voting relationships among U.S. Senators from 2009 to 2014 in attempt to quantify congressional bipartisanship. It also assesses each Senator's legislative influence in Congress using Google's PageRank algorithm. All data in this project is directly accessed from www.GovTrack.us, a public archive of Congressional bills and congressmen's voting records.
