## Basic Python setup for data analysis
The IPython notebook runs in the browser, and works best in Google Chrome. The Anaconda Python distribution is an easily-installable bundle of Python and many commonly used libraries. Download the appropriate version of Anaconda [here](http://continuum.io/downloads). 

Extra libraries that are useful for python:

1. [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
2. [Pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern)
3. [Seaborn](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)
4. [MrJob](http://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/)

The recommended way to install these packages is to run ```pip install BeautifulSoup mrjob pattern seaborn``` on the command line. If this doesn't work, you can download the source code, and run ```python setup.py install``` from the source code directory. On Unix machines, either of these commands may require ```sudo``` (i.e. ```sudo pip install```... or ```sudo python```)
