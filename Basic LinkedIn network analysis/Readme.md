The scripts query and analyse your Linkedin network information as follow (**Note**: Need `pip install oauth2` and `pip install unidecode` to access your Linkedin data):

1. **linkedin.py** accesses your profile and outputs your network connections into a linkedIn_clean.csv file. The script is modified from Harvard CS109. I have not uploaded my network data for privacy reasons. You can further explore your csv file with Gephi.
2. **pagerank.py** calculates the pagerank of the nodes and output the basic statistics about your network. **Output**: network.png, networkStats.txt
