**PageRank algorithm.ipynb** implements a scalable PageRank algorithm on the Google web graph dataset `Google.txt`. Use a random teleporting probability of 0.2 and calculate the PageRank value of node '99'.

**LSH.py** reads the file `sentences.txt` that contains 9.398 million sentences that are 10 words or longer, then prints the number of pairs in which the edit distance <= 1 ie. sentence 1 can be transformed to sentence 2 by adding, removing or substituting a single word. The dataset is accessible [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/mmds/datasets/sentences.txt.zip).
