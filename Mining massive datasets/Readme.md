**PageRank algorithm.ipynb** implements a scalable PageRank algorithm on the Google web graph dataset `Google.txt`. Use a random teleporting probability of 0.2 and calculate the PageRank value of node '99'.

**LSH.py** finds the number of pairs of sentences that are at the word-level edit distance at most 1. Two sentences S1 and S2 they are at edit distance 1 if S1 can be transformed to S2 by: adding, removing or substituting a single word. The dataset is accessible [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/mmds/datasets/sentences.txt.zip)
